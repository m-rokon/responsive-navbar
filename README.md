# # Respnsive Navbar :desktop_computer: :computer: :iphone: 

It's a beginner level navbar which is built with the help of `TailwindCSS` and `vanilla JS`. I built to reuse it in the future and save some time while coding :wink: 

Never mind, it's free for everyone. So you can use it too. Enjoy and happy coding :tada:
